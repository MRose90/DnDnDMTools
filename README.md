# DnDnDMTools
 A website for dungeon management for D&D.

## Description

The website will procedurally generate a dungeon where dungeon masters can add notes, encounters and loot to each of the chambers. The dungeon will also allow for an overarching soundtrack via YouTube or Spotify. Each chamber can also have it's own soundtrack. 

Encounters can be created using custom monsters or monsters from the SRD(Pathfinder and 5e?).

## Process For Creating The Dungeon

* Follow the guide for building a dungeon given [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dlwc4/procedural_dungeon_generation_algorithm_explained/). 

## Further Development

Build a discord bot that allows the map to be displayed with fog of war. Allow the DM to update the image on Discord using the website. Link the bot with Spotify and YouTube to automatically change the music.
